# About

### Welcome to Bellingcat’s Online Open Source Investigation Toolkit!

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Toolkit Logo Black.png" alt="" width="250"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This is your place to discover tools! Our toolkit includes satellite and mapping services, tools for verifying photos and videos, websites to archive web pages, and much more. Most of the tools that we include can be used for free!

Bellingcat’s Online Investigation Toolkit has a long tradition but our newest version is special: It is offered in collaboration with the Bellingcat volunteer community. Click on "Details" on the right hand side of each entry (if available) to receive an in-depth description of the tool.

This toolkit is still a work-in-progress and the number of available tool descriptions will grow over time.

<summary>Our Toolkit Maintainers</summary>

Our toolkit is a community-driven project. Various community members contribute to writing toolkit descriptions. They know the ins and outs of “their tools” and are able to provide information about their advantages and limitations. If they choose to be publicly mentioned, you can find their names on individual tool pages under "page maintainer".
